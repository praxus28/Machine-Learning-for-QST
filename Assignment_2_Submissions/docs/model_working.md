The model is a multilayer perceptron that maps measurement statistics to a valid quantum density matrix. Instead of predicting the density matrix directly, the network predicts the parameters of a lower triangular matrix L. The density matrix is reconstructed using the Cholesky decomposition rho = (L L†) / Tr(L L†), which guarantees Hermiticity, positivity, and unit trace by construction.
