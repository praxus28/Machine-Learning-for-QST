# Results

## Fidelity
As the number of qubits increases, the mean fidelity decreases.  
This behavior is expected due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space.

## Runtime
The average runtime increases rapidly with the number of qubits, reflecting the increased computational complexity of state representation and evaluation.

## Observations
- Low-qubit systems show stable and high fidelities
- Higher-qubit systems exhibit increased variance
- Runtime scaling dominates practical feasibility
