## Key Challenges
- Managing output directories to prevent silent file write failures
- Ensuring consistent data keys between experiment and plotting stages
- Debugging scalability issues without explicit runtime errors

## Insights
This experiment demonstrates the fundamental scalability limits of quantum tomography, even when using surrogate models.

While machine learning can accelerate reconstruction, the exponential growth of quantum states remains a critical bottleneck.
