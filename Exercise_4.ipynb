    "- A quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is a completely positive, trace-preserving map. We write $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\sum_k K_k \\rho K_k^\\dagger$ with $\\sum_k K_k^\\dagger K_k = I$ so that each Kraus operator $K_k$ captures one noise branch.\n",
    "- The Choi matrix $C_{\\mathcal{E}} = (\\mathcal{E} \\otimes I)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$ models how the channel acts on half of an entangled pair. Flattening its real and imaginary parts gives a steady feature vector.\n",
