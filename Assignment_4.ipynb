    "Work through the tasks below to show how tomography supports real use cases. Keep the language simple in your notes so the reader can follow easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task list**\n",
    "1. **Algorithm validation**: Pick one quantum algorithm (for example, Grover search or a small variational routine). Run your surrogate or simulator, reconstruct the output state with tomography, and check if the measured fidelity backs up the algorithm claims.\n",
    "2. **Noise channel check**: Choose a noise process (depolarising, amplitude damping, etc.). Use tomography to estimate the state before and after the channel. Compare the results with the expected Kraus or process model.\n",
    "3. **Quantum detector tomography (QDT)**: Calibrate a detector model by sending known probe states, collecting outcomes, and rebuilding the POVM elements. Explain how accurate detection helps in your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables**\n",
    "- Brief write-up describing each experiment setup, observed fidelity or error, and lessons learned.\n",
    "- Plots or tables that compare target and reconstructed states for all tasks.\n",
    "- Saved artefacts (`models/`, `results/`, `plots/`) with short README notes on how to reload or reproduce."
