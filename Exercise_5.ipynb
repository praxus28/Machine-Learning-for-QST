    "- **Significance:** HHL demonstrates how phase estimation and controlled rotations implement linear-system inversion with logarithmic qubit scaling, which is appealing for quantum simulation, matrix-conditioned pre-processing, and certain machine-learning primitives.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** The asymptotic advantage depends on sparse Hermitian encodings and bounded condition numbers; precision demands deepen the circuit, so practical runtimes still balloon as systems grow dense or ill-conditioned.\n",
    "- **Shortcomings:** Near-term devices face depth and error-rate limits, and reading out full solution vectors erodes theoretical speed-ups. Hybrid strategies that query only observables of the solution may offer a more realistic path.\n",
    "- **Role of QST:** Machine-learned tomography can recycle measurement data across runs and reconstruct hidden amplitudes, but it introduces extra sampling and compute overhead, so improving QST efficiency is pivotal when turning HHL into a practical subroutine."
